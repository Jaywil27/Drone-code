This is code for a drone project I am setting up currently it is bitbanging a throttle of 99 using dshot the bits are stored in a array and the xor is hardcoded 


This branch is for testing a more optimized approach to bitbanging currently this is using a rmt to control the timings it does not work as of now as the bit timings are off
